# mypage
Opdracht 1 voor programmeerplatformen

I tried to make a personal webpage. After spending the entire Tuesday afternoon on figuring out the navigation and background image of the homepage I gave up and just met all the requirements.

I made folders to organize the project better. I'll briefly elaborate on them:

css: This contains all the css and scss files
fonts: I saw this font I liked and put it in this folder. I believe I only use it once
html: This contains all te html files
img: This contains all the images I reference
logo: I had this idea of adding my social media to the page. I've not used it for now.
